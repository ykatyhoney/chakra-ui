**Transition** `v1.3.8`

**Media Query** `v1.1.5`

- Corrected eslint errors.
- This fixes an issue where the useMediaQuery was not updating the array of
  statuses correctly when resizing the view. It also removes deprecated calls
  addListener and removeListener in favor of the recommended addEventListener and
  removeEventListener calls.

**Color Mode** `v1.2.0`

- Added possibility to use the system preferred color scheme as value for
  `initialColorMode`, while still respecting a user's previous choice.

As long as the user does not manually select a color mode through a website
interaction, the theme will change when the system preference changes.

This would easily allow for an implementation where the user can choose between
`light`, `dark` and `system` by simply setting the `initialColorMode` setting to
`system` and presenting the user with the three options.

**Popper** `v2.3.1`

- fix(popper): allow useCallback to do its thing
